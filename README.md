# The Employee Management System - EMS

The purpose of this application is to store information about companies and employees in a PostgreSQL database server. It uses the JDBC driver to persist to the database. The app implements features such as adding, viewing, editing and removing companies and employees. The UI is built using JavaFX. Information stored in the database includes the name, address, founding date and activity field of each company, as well as the name, salary, hiring date, and a few more, regarding each employee of each company.

Project is still in the "Work in progress" stage.
